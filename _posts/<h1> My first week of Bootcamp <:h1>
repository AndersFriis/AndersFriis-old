<h1> My first week of Bootcamp </h1>
<p> I quit a good job in the city, to restart my career. That statement alone is very scary. Stepping outside your comfort zone and start a new career at the age of 33 is very scary. Luckily my first week of Bootcamp proved that as long as you network and follow instructions you will be just fine. So far we've done basic websites and dipped into CSS. Every morning we have our "morning warmups" which consist of basic language in either python or JavaScript. In the beginning I had no idea what was going on or how to do any of the challenges. But after day 5 I suddenly started understanding why, how and what we were actually trying to do. Hopefully by the end of week 2 I will be reporting that the morning warmups are a breeze. </p>
